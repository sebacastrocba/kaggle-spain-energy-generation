# Kaggle Spain Energy Dataset

## Dataset

Forecasting in energy markets is identified as one of the highest leverage contribution areas of Machine/Deep Learning toward transitioning to a renewable based electrical infrastructure.

The dataset is unique because it contains hourly data for electrical consumption and the respective forecasts by the TSO for consumption and pricing. This allows prospective forecasts to be benchmarked against the current state of the art forecasts being used in industry.

The dataset was downloaded from [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather)

## Objective

Can we forecast 24 hours in advance better than the TSO?
